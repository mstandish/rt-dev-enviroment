A penny for your thoughts
Break the ice
Let the cat out of the bag
Bite the bullet
Kick the bucket
Hit the nail on the head
Piece of cake
Under the weather
Spill the beans
The ball is in your court
Back to the drawing board
Burn the midnight oil
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Cut corners
Devil's advocate
Every cloud has a silver lining
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Go the extra mile
In the heat of the moment
Jump on the bandwagon
Keep your eyes peeled
Let sleeping dogs lie
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
On the fence
Pulling your leg
Rain on someone's parade
Take it with a grain of salt
The best of both worlds
Throw in the towel
Up in the air
Your guess is as good as mine
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
All in the same boat
At the drop of a hat
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Break a leg
By the skin of your teeth
Call it a day
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Easy come, easy go
Face the music
Get a taste of your own medicine
Give the cold shoulder
Go back to square one
Hang in there
Hit the sack
In a pickle
In the nick of time
It takes two to tango
Jump the gun
Keep your chin up
Last straw
Let bygones be bygones
Make a long story short
Not playing with a full deck
Off the hook
On thin ice
Out of the blue
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Pass the buck
Pull yourself together
Put all your cards on the table
Raining cats and dogs
See eye to eye
Shoot the breeze
Sit tight
Smell a rat
Speak of the devil
Steal someone's thunder
Take the bull by the horns
Take the cake
The elephant in the room
The whole nine yards
Throw caution to the wind
Turn a blind eye
Under your nose
When pigs fly
You can't judge a book by its cover
A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
A perfect storm
All bark and no bite
An arm and a leg
Bite off more than you can chew
By leaps and bounds
Cry over spilled milk
Down to the wire
Drive someone up the wall
Feather in your cap
Fish out of water
Fly off the handle
From the horse's mouth
Get a foot in the door
Get cold feet
Get your act together
Give someone a run for their money
Go down in flames
Have bigger fish to fry
Have your head in the clouds
Hit the ground running
In hot water
Keep your fingers crossed
Let the chips fall where they may
Make waves
Not the sharpest tool in the shed
Off the beaten path
On cloud nine
Out of the woods
Play it by ear
Put a sock in it
Raise the bar
Read between the lines
Rock the boat
Shape up or ship out
Shoot for the moon
Sitting duck
Skate on thin ice
The early bird catches the worm
The icing on the cake
Think outside the box
Throw your weight around
Turn over a new leaf
Up the creek without a paddle
Walk on eggshells
You can't have your cake and eat it too
A watched pot never boils
Back to square one
Better safe than sorry
Bite the dust
Burn bridges
Cut to the chase
Don't beat a dead horse
Don't cry wolf
Down in the dumps
Drop the ball
Every dog has its day
Get off on the wrong foot
Get the show on the road
Go out on a limb
Have a chip on your shoulder
Have the upper hand
Hit the books
In the blink of an eye
In the same boat
It's not rocket science
Keep an eye out
Keep your head above water
Let off steam
Make ends meet
No strings attached
Off the cuff
On the ball
Out of left field
Play devil's advocate
Put your money where your mouth is
Raise eyebrows
Run out of steam
Save for a rainy day
Shoot yourself in the foot
So far so good
Speak your mind
Stick to your guns
The tip of the iceberg
The writing on the wall
Tie the knot
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Two peas in a pod
Wear your heart on your sleeve
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A drop in the ocean
A leopard can't change its spots
All ears
All thumbs
At wit's end
Bend over backwards
Birds of a feather flock together
Blow off steam
Break the bank
Burn the candle at both ends
By the book
Call the shots
Caught red-handed
Clam up
Cut and dried
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't put the cart before the horse
Down for the count
Draw a blank
Fall on deaf ears
Fool's gold
For crying out loud
Get a second wind
Get your ducks in a row
Go off the deep end
Go out of your way
Have a field day
Have a heart
Hold your horses
In a nutshell
In the bag
It's a small world
Jump through hoops
Keep your shirt on
Know the ropes
Lay down the law
Lead by example
Leave no stone unturned
Let nature take its course
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Make the grade
Move the goalposts
No-brainer
On a roll
On the same page
Out for the count
Paint the town red
Play it safe
Pull a fast one
Put the pedal to the metal
Raise the roof
Ring a bell
Rule of thumb
See the light
Set the record straight
Sink or swim
Sit on the fence
Sleep on it
Snowed under
Split hairs
Start from scratch
Stick your neck out
Straight from the horse's mouth
Take five
Take it or leave it
Take the plunge
The ballpark figure
The bottom line
The last straw
The long and short of it
The pot calling the kettle black
There's no place like home
Through thick and thin
Throw someone under the bus
To each their own
Turn the tables
Under the radar
Up in arms
Water under the bridge
Wear many hats
Without a hitch
Word of mouth
You snooze, you lose
A stitch in time saves nine
All in good time
Back to basics
Better luck next time
Blow the whistle
Break even
Bring home the bacon
By the numbers
Cast in stone
Clear as mud
Close but no cigar
Come rain or shine
Drop the mic
Easy does it
Every man for himself
Eye for an eye
Fair and square
Few and far between
For the record
Get a grip
Get your wires crossed
Go for broke
Have a bone to pick
Hold the fort
In the loop
It's all Greek to me
Jump ship
Lay it on the line
Leave well enough alone
Make a clean sweep
No holds barred
On the back burner
Out of sight, out of mind
Pick up the slack
Play second fiddle
Put your thinking cap on
Rack your brain
Set in stone
Shoot the messenger
Sit on your hands
Take the high road
The bigger picture
The devil is in the details
There's no time like the present
Throw your hat in the ring
Too good to be true
Turn the other cheek
Walk in someone else's shoes
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
A far cry from
All bets are off
At the eleventh hour
Backseat driver
Bite the hand that feeds you
Bring down the house
By hook or by crook
Call it quits
Caught in the crossfire
Change your tune
Cross your heart
Cry uncle
Cut and run
Dead ringer
Don't have a cow
Don't hold your breath
Draw the line
Drop a dime
Eat humble pie
Elbow room
For the birds
Get the ball rolling
Get your feet wet
Give it a whirl
Go against the grain
Head in the sand
Hold all the aces
In the driver's seat
It's not over until the fat lady sings
Jump the shark
Keep your nose clean
Let your hair down
Make a killing
No dice
On the wagon
Out of your depth
Pick your poison
Play hardball
Put two and two together
Raise the stakes
Read the fine print
Ring in the new year
Rub salt in the wound
Run a tight ship
See which way the wind blows
Settle the score
Sink like a stone
Sleep like a log
Stand tall
Take a back seat
Take the rough with the smooth
The jury is still out
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Throw a wrench in the works
Under the gun
Up to your ears
Wake up and smell the coffee
When push comes to shove
Your mileage may vary
A stone's throw
All over the map
At the end of the day
Back in the saddle
Beat a hasty retreat
Blow your cover
Break new ground
Bring to the table
Caught napping
Cheap as chips
Come to grips
Cross the Rubicon
Cut your losses
Eat crow
Fill in the blanks
Fly by night
For Pete's sake
Get a move on
Get off your high horse
Give someone a piece of your mind
Go Dutch
Go haywire
Have a monkey on your back
Hit the jackpot
Hold water
In a heartbeat
Jump out of your skin
Keep a stiff upper lip
Let the grass grow under your feet
Make a fast buck
Make no bones about it
On the ropes
Out of commission
Pick up the pace
Play your cards right
Put your foot in your mouth
Raise Cain
Read someone the riot act
Ring true
Run out of gas
See the writing on the wall
Set your sights on
Sleep tight
Speak volumes
Stand in good stead
Take a leaf out of someone's book
Take the edge off
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The more the merrier
The world is your oyster
There's light at the end of the tunnel
Throw the baby out with the bathwater
Time is money
Turn a deaf ear
Under lock and key
Up to scratch
Walk the talk
Wear your thinking cap
You can say that again
Your days are numbered
A dog's breakfast
A house of cards
All over but the shouting
Back against the wall
Beat the odds
Blow smoke
Bring to light
Caught short
Cheap shot
Come full circle
Don't get me wrong
Down but not out
Eat like a horse
Fall from grace
Find your calling
Fly in the ointment
For old times' sake
Get cracking
Give someone a leg up
Go the whole hog
Have a soft spot
Head over heels in love
Hold all the cards
In the clear
In the hot seat
Jump at the chance
Keep a lid on it
Make a pig of yourself
Make the cut
No questions asked
On the mend
Out of the ordinary
Pick holes in
Play it cool
Put out feelers
Raise the curtain
Read someone like a book
Ring the changes
Set the wheels in motion
Shoot the moon
Stand the test of time
Take a dim view
The buck stops here
The coast is clear
Throw caution to the wind
Wear many hats
A clean slate
A cut above
A false sense of security
A flash in the pan
A slap on the wrist
All hands on deck
At the end of your rope
Back to the grind
Beat the clock
Bite your tongue
Blow your own trumpet
By the seat of your pants
Caught off guard
Change of heart
Come hell or high water
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Dig in your heels
Don't quit your day job
Down to earth
Drop in the bucket
Eat your words
Face value
Fifty-fifty
Find your feet
First things first
Give and take
Have a blast
If the shoe fits, wear it
In one ear and out the other
Jump to conclusions
Keep your nose to the grindstone
Let the good times roll
Make a beeline
Make your mark
Money talks
On your toes
Play with fire
Put your foot down
Quick on the draw
Rain check
Read the riot act
Red herring
Roll with the punches
Rough around the edges
Seal the deal
Shoot from the hip
Sit in the driver's seat
Sleeping giant
Smell the roses
Speak your mind
Stick to your guns
The tip of the iceberg
The writing on the wall
